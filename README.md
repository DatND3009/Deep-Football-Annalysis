# Deep Football Analysis by Deep Learning
## Introduction
Deep Football Analysis leverages the power of cutting-edge deep learning to bring a smarter, automated way to track and analyze football matches. Using a combination of YOLOv11 - which is state-of-the-art model in object detection, Supervision, and OpenCV, this project delivers real-time insights by detecting players, tracking movements, and extracting key statistics. Whether you're a data scientist, a football analyst, or just a curious fan, this project is for you.
This project builds upon the impressive work by the Roboflow team. You can explore more of their exciting projects on their [GitHub repository](https://github.com/roboflow/sports)

## Modules used

- [YOLOv11](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov11/) (Players Detection) - Detects 
players, goalkeepers and referees in the video.
- [YOLOv11](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov11/) (Ball Detection) - Detects the ball in the video.
- [YOLOv11](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov11/) (Pitch Detection) - Detects keypoints on the pitch, used for perspective transformation, speed estimation and ball controlling analysis
- [KMeans](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html) - 
Segment pixels and divide players into two teams based on their t-shirt color
- [Supervision](https://supervision.roboflow.com/0.18.0/) and [OpenCV](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/index.html) for annotations and draw statistic information


## Requirements

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note on Real-Time Tracking

This project is fully capable of handling real-time tracking. However, pay special attention to the following part of the code:

```
crops = extract_crop(PLAYERS_MODEL, "football.mp4", 2)
team_classifier = TeamClassifier()
team_classifier.fit(crops)
```


In this example, the same video is used to fit the `TeamClassifier` model and for tracking. While this works for demonstration purposes, it is not recommended for real-time applications.

For accurate real-time performance, make sure to use a different input video in the `extract_crop` function ‚Äî ideally, a recording from a previous match played on the same pitch and captured with a similar camera angle and format. This helps the model generalize better and improves team classification accuracy during live tracking.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges

- **Model Generalization**  
  The models used in this project have been trained on a specific dataset tailored to the project's demo setup. If you apply them to different camera angles, lighting conditions, or pitch configurations, the performance may degrade significantly.

- **Goalkeeper Misclassification**  
  While YOLOv11 generally performs well in distinguishing players and goalkeepers, it occasionally misclassifies goalkeepers ‚Äî particularly when they are controlling the ball with their feet rather than their hands ‚Äî as outfield players.

- **Lighting and Shadow Variability**  
  Varying lighting conditions (e.g., stadium shadows, artificial lights, night matches) can affect detection and tracking accuracy, especially in outdoor environments. Moreover, `TeamClassifier` - which implemented by `KMeans` will be affected as well when meet lighting and shadow variability

- **Occlusions and Player Overlaps**  
  Players often overlap or occlude each other, which can make detection and tracking unreliable during crowded scenes like corners or goalmouth scrambles.

- **Real-Time Processing Limitations**  
  Running deep learning models in real-time requires sufficient computational resources (especially GPU). On lower-end machines, the frame rate can drop, reducing usability for live analysis.
